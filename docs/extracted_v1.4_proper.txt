The DUNS number
International identification number for 
third parties

4D-U-N-S 
Number 
(Data Universal 
Numbering System)-Created in 1962 in the United States
-Trademark registered and used by D&B
-Unique identification system for all companies 
(natural or legal persons) and organisations
(humanitarian, governmental, etc.) with a recognised
existence and activity.
-Internationally Recognized
-Used notably by the United Nations (1991).
-The United States Federal Government (1994)
-The European Commission (1995) -9-digit number
-Exclusively allocated and managed by D&B, its 
subsidiaries and partners (free registration)
-More than 265 million companies referenced
-In more than 220 countriesThe DUNS number
We first identify a third partie before enriching its data

Never reused or reallocated to another entity
Audit and control system implemented in each site (country or geographical area). 
Its mission :
-Preventing the reuse and/or reallocation of a pre -existing DUNS number
-Avoid the loss of relevant data by reconciling duplicates (if the same company had been allocated to 2 Duns)
-Maintain a database of deleted Duns with an indicator showing the reason for the deletion and, if possible, the Duns that rep laced 
it.

Duns that need to be removed must therefore be removed before the renewal date of the contract.

Miscellaneous  questions

--- Page 49 ---
Is data update available  for all countries?
Yes for all
Is it necessary to pay for a report again if we consult it again? 
Multiple consultation is based on the contractual year. A Duns consulted several times over the 
contractual year will only be charged once for that year. If a request is made for a new year then in that 
case there will be a new billing for that new year.
Limit on the number of DUNS for the test account ?
The user provided for the tests is set for 300 DUNS. If an overrun is observed an invoicing can be made. 
This is why it is advisable to use PROD DUNS if tests with larger volumes have to be carried out.
