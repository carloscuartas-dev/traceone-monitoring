# Real-World Test Guide

## Test Scenarios

### 1. **Full Integration Test** (Recommended)
Test the complete monitoring system with local files feeding into your existing handlers.

### 2. **Production-like Test**
Set up a test environment that mirrors your production configuration.

### 3. **Performance Test**
Test with larger file volumes and measure processing performance.

### 4. **End-to-End Pipeline Test**
Process files → Generate notifications → Store to SFTP/Local → Verify data flow

## Let's Choose Your Test Approach

**Which test scenario interests you most?**

1. **Quick Integration Test** - Test local files with your existing SFTP/local storage handlers
2. **Production Simulation** - Set up a complete test environment with monitoring config
3. **Data Pipeline Verification** - Process files and verify the notifications reach your storage systems
4. **Performance Benchmark** - Test with all your files and measure throughput

**Or tell me:**
- Do you want to test with your existing DNB API configuration?
- Should we set up a test SFTP server/directory for output?
- Are you interested in seeing the notifications stored in a specific format?
- Do you want to test the continuous monitoring (polling) functionality?
