What is a Registration?
A registration tells D&B:
‚Ä¢ Which companies to monitor (DUNS numbers)
‚Ä¢ What data fields to track for changes

Registration Components:
‚Ä¢ Reference: Unique identifier for the registration

‚Ä¢ Data Blocks: Categories of data to monitor (e.g., company info, financials)
‚Ä¢ JSON Path Inclusion: Specific fields within data blocks
‚Ä¢ Delivery Settings: How notifications are delivered

Registration Lifecycle:
1. Create registration with D&B
2. D&B validates DUNS numbers and data access rights
3. Registration becomes ACTIVE for monitoring
4. Add/remove DUNS numbers as needed
5. Monitor registration status and health

Notification Structure:

‚Ä¢ Organization: Company information (DUNS, basic data)
‚Ä¢ Elements: Array of changed data fields with before/after values
‚Ä¢ Timestamps: When change occurred and when delivered
‚Ä¢ Processing Status: Success/failure tracking

Handler Processing:

6. Connection pooling and retry logic

Local File Storage Process:
1. Create local directory structure with proper permissions
2. Store notifications with rich metadata
3. Support multiple formats (JSON, CSV, XML)
4. Optional compression and file rotation
5. Statistics tracking and health monitoring

2. Task runs infinite loop with polling interval delays
3. Each iteration: poll for notifications ‚Üí process ‚Üí store
4. Handle errors gracefully without stopping
5. Log all operations for monitoring and debugging
